# 🍔 Food Ordering Chatbot

An end-to-end food ordering chatbot that uses Dialogflow for Natural Language Understanding (NLU), FastAPI for the backend fulfillment, and a MySQL database for managing menu items and orders. The chatbot can handle conversation flows for placing orders, tracking order status, and managing session contexts.

## ✨ Features

- **Natural Language Ordering**: Users can order food using natural conversation (e.g., "I want 2 pizzas and a mango lassi").
- **Order Tracking**: Users can ask for the status of their order using their order ID.
- **Context Management**: Maintains session context to handle follow-up requests (e.g., "Add one more to that").
- **Menu Management**: Backend connected to a database to fetch live menu items and prices.
- **Multi-platform Support**: Can be integrated with messaging platforms that Dialogflow supports.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS (Web Interface)
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **NLU Engine**: Google Dialogflow
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Tunneling**: Ngrok (for local development)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
1. Install MySQL and MySQL Workbench.
2. Import the database dump from the `db/` folder into your MySQL instance.
3. Update database credentials in the backend configuration if necessary.

### 2. Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Or individually:
   # pip install mysql-connector "fastapi[all]"
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### 3. Dialogflow Setup
1. Create a new Agent in Google Dialogflow.
2. Import the intents and entities from `dialogflow_assets/`.
3. Configure the **Fulfillment** webhook URL to point to your backend (see Ngrok setup).

### 4. Ngrok Setup (for HTTPS Tunneling)
Since Dialogflow requires a public HTTPS URL for webhooks, use Ngrok to expose your local server.
1. Download [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. Run Ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
3. Copy the HTTPS URL generated by Ngrok and paste it into the Dialogflow Fulfillment Webhook URL field.

### 5. Frontend Setup
1. Open the `frontend/` folder.
2. Launch `index.html` in your browser to test the chatbot integration.

## 📝 Notes
- Ngrok sessions expire on the free plan; if you see a timeout, restart Ngrok and update the webhook URL in Dialogflow.
